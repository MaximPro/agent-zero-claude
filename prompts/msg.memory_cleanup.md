# Cleanup raw memories from database
- You will receive two data collections:
    1. Conversation history of AI agent.
    2. Raw memories from vector database based on similarity score.
- Your job is to remove all memories from the database that are not relevant to the topic of the conversation history and only return memories that are relevant and helpful for future of the conversation.

- Focus on the end of the conversation history, that is where the most current topic is.
